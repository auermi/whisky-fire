# Whisky Fire

A glorious screen saver of [Nick Offerman drinking whisky](https://youtube.com/watch?v=LS-ErOKpO4E).


## Building

You’ll need [Xcode 7](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/download) or higher.

1. First, let’s get the code by running this command:

        git clone https://github.com/soffes/whisky-fire


2. Build and install the screen saver with these commands:

        cd whisky-fire
        rake

This make ask you to install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh). There will be instructions in the output. If System Preferences says the screen saver won’t work on your version of OS X, simply restart System Preferences and it should work.

Enjoy.
