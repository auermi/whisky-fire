# Whisky Fire

A glorious screen saver of [Nick Offerman drinking whisky](https://youtube.com/watch?v=LS-ErOKpO4E).


## Building

You’ll need [Xcode 7](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/download) or higher.

1. First, let’s get the code:

        git clone https://github.com/soffes/whisky-fire
        cd whisky-fire

2. Install the screen saver:

       rake

This make ask you to install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh). There will be instructions in the output. If System Preferences says the screen saver won’t work on your version of OS X, simply restart System Preferences and it should work.

Enjoy.
